DESCRIPTION

This program blocks out all of the known domains and IPs that Windows 10 uses for telemetry and tracking.
This program is designed for Windows 10, but should also work in previous versions of Windows.
It is also capable of removing the added entries from the hosts file, in case you want to go back.

CONFIGURATION

Ensure that win10_privacytool.py and hostslist.txt are both present and located in the same directory.

USAGE

Run as administrator. Go through the tool's dialogue to add or remove blocking entries from your hosts file.

Have fun.
